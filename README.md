Date, time, and notes: (create your own category?: vet, dog friendly places, foods she loves, recipes she loves)

"Took Bonnie to see a local vet today who scared me into thinking she needed surgery, decided to wait
and went to her primary vet to double check, turns out she just needed the cyst to be removed and cleaned
without surgery being involved. Learned that it's always best to go with a second or third opinion, don't
let fear cloud your judgement."

"Took Bonnie to Disneyland today, the kennel was clean but includes nothing, so next time I need to be
prepared by bringing blankets, toys, water, and food. The fee is $20 per day and opens an hour before"

Reminders: {vet appointment, birthdays, friends' birthdays, national dog related days, dog events nearby/coming up}

//Medical records

//Budget:
	//grooming
	//food
	//medical
	//insurance

//Microchip ID (hidden since it shows owner's information): if animal is ever found, there's a form you can input the ID and it will alert the owner of their found pet and release contact info to the founder if you want to do so
